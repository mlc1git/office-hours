                <h3>KEY SKILLS</h3>             
            
                  <h4>Leadership:</h4>  
                  <p>As an experienced Shift manager I have successfully lead teams of up to 30 staff members, 
                    ensuring that staggered and socially distanced breaks were adhered to. Gained trust within 
                    the team showing willingness to adapt to any issue.</p>
                  <h4>Communication:</h4>  
                  <p>I have good written and verbal skills allowing me to confidently relay tasks or targets. 
                    This also allows me to accurately deliver coaching or training needs.</p>
                  <h4>Problem Solving:</h4>  
                  <p> I have developed this skill over many years from working in different industries 
                    querying what makes things work to make them work better or correctly, 
                    minimising downtime and increasing productivity.</p>
                  <h4>Attention to Detail:</h4> 
                  <p> Given my previous roles this is a must have, just the slightest miscalculation 
                    can have major consequences, whether it be personnel or equipment issues they need sorting fast.</p>
